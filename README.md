# Check-Up(still under development)

React Native Application to simplify the world of pickup basketball

# Tech Stack:
FE: React Native
BE: Firebase, Node JS

# Features(Planned and Done)

1. Find Courts Near Any Location in the U.S
2. Queue up your teams for games at that court 
3. View a Google Maps StreetView of the court to scout out the details(double rim, blacktop, etc) 
4. Message other teams through our Cloud Messaging, so don't need to exchange multiple pieces of contact information.
